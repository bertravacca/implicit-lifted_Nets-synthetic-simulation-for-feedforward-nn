# implicit-lifted_Nets-synthetic-simulation-for-feedforward-nn
We make our code and simulations available for the 'Synthetic feedforward neural network' section from our article 'Implicit Lifted Nets' (L.El Ghaoui, F.Gu, B.Travacca, A.Askari, 2019).
You will need MATLAB R2019A or above with the Deep Learning Toobox installed. The simulation can be found in the Live Script file 'fenchel_young_NNs'.
